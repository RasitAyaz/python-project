# Zoom Poll Report Analyzer

## Vision
Zoom poll is a system used to measure students' success and attendance in the lesson. In this program, questions are asked to the students by the instructor during the lesson. Students are expected to answer questions. Answers given by students are recorded in a report.

## Scope
The aim of this project is to determine the success percentage and the attendance of the class according to the answers given by the students at the poll. There may be more than one poll data in our Poll report file. Our program makes the student's success calculations by separating these poll data from each other. A separate report is created for each student according to the answers given.
